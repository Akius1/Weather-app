# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Weather Application

This is portable react js web application for weather forecasting and current weather condition based on a user location

### Technologies Used

- React 
- Chakra UI
- React Query

## UI styling
Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

I choose Chakra UI because is very flexible and easy to get started with.

## State management 
React Query
React Query is a good tool for Fetching, caching and updating data in your React applications all without touching any "global state" and with just few lines of code. And I feel this project does not require the ambiguity of redux.
